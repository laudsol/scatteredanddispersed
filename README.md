Data for the project can be uploaded by the admin in the form of a CVS file dropped into the S3 bucket.

The timeframe is flexible, allowing the user to view snapshots of data at intervals of custom length. The input box on the upper right controls the interval and the the scroll bar beneath it controls the time frame.

Clicking on any of the data cards will zoom in on the corespnding data point on the map. Clicking on any data point on the map will scroll to and highlight the corresponding data card.
